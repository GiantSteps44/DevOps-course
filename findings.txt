Things Containers share with the host are

- Host kernel sound (ALSA) interphase /proc/asound
- ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) probably to
spin up or shutdown container OS /proc/acpi
- Physical memory /proc/kcore
- Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) for harddrives etc. /proc/SCSI

- And in general containers share host kernel (look a bit deeper into this)
 and this means that containers can make system calls or requests for host OS
 to use sound card, power, memory or HardDrive services. However, system calls
 limit containers privileges to directly access hardware and this creates isolation
 probably. Then some lines in my python and C# seems like system call activities.

 Both of which are pretty cool actually :)
